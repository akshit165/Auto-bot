# Auto-bot

We have developed an algorithm for qr detection using certain image processing and computer vision techniques and integrated it with the car motors such that whenever the qr reads "left", the car turns left, and for "right", it turns right. Also, for obstacle detection, we have used ultrasonic sensor which will stop the bot whenever any obstacles comes in its way, and move towards another direction. I have demonstrated our algorithm in this video.

For future scope, we have decided to implement deep learning techniques as well as add voice instructions in the bot.
In this project, we have used following components:-

•	Raspberry Pi 3B+

•	Arduino UNO

•	4*DC Motor

•	Servo Motor

•	Ultrasonic Sensor

•	L298N Dual H Bridge Motor Driver

•	Logitech C270 Webcam

•	4*Tyres

•	Mechanical Chassis
